## 🌱 How to Contribute (Branches & Pull Requests)

If you want to make changes to the site, it’s best to create a **branch** (a copy of the code) so your edits don’t affect the main site until they are reviewed.

### 1. Create a New Branch
```bash
# Make sure you are on the main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest updates
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch (replace my-edit with your own name)
git checkout -b my-edit
